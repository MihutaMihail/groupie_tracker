## README
This is an older project (from last year) and the API used for getting a visual representation in google maps of the specific location may not work since the key for the API may of expired / got deleted / etc. I will probably not keep the project updated the geolocation may not work. <br>
**(10/01/2024 is when I have last changed the API key)**

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to create an app using **fyne**. The app will be using the API **Groupie Trackers** that is used to simplify the search of your favourite artists. We'll need to integrate all the information from the API inside the app which would be the artists themselves, the locations that they've performed at and the dates of these performances. This app will be used as a visual representation of the API content.

## Role in the project
This is a group project between 3 people. My part can be seen inside **/DataAPI** and **/Geocoding** and **/Windows/Pages/Filters.go**. This means that I have worked on the access to the API and getting all the necessary info, retrieving the geolocation of the locations inside the original API **Groupie Trackers** and the filters. Everything else meaning the search bar, the design of the app itself or anything else that is not what I have mentioned above, has not been made by me.

## About
â€¢ As of last year, when the project was created, it was fully functional. I cannot guarantee its continued fonctionality, as the API **Groupie Trackers** may undergo changes, potentially causing the app to cease working or at least some parts of it.
